# Minecraft-Discord Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of a Minecraft bot and a Discord bot, allowing users to interact with a Minecraft server from a Discord channel. The Minecraft bot is created using the `mineflayer` library, and the Discord bot is created using the `discord.js` library.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: npm is bundled with Node.js, so no separate installation is required.

# Configuration

- Replace 'ENTER OWN TOKEN' with your Discord bot token in the script.
- Replace 'ENTER OWN CHANNEL' with your Discord channel ID in the script.
- Customize the Minecraft bot settings such as server address, port, and username as needed.

# Discord Commands

- !help: Displays a help message in the Discord channel.
- !status: Checks the status of the Minecraft server and posts a status message.
- !players: Lists the players currently online on the Minecraft server.
  
# Minecraft Bot Features
- Authentication with the Minecraft server using /register and /login commands.
- Joining a specific game mode using /opsurv.
- Chat integration between Discord and Minecraft.
