# Minecraft-Discord Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of a Minecraft bot and a Discord bot, allowing users to interact with a Minecraft server from a Discord channel. The Minecraft bot is created using the `mineflayer` library, and the Discord bot is created using the `discord.js` library.
